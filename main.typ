Analyze and act on achievement data by creating an instructional plan using achievement data 
Analyzing student data such as assessment scores, attendance records, or feedback helps to identify individual or collective areas of strength and areas for improvement. This information enables you to tailor your instructional plan to address the specific needs of your students. Individual student data can also guide you in personalizing instruction. By understanding each student's strengths and weaknesses, you can tailor your teaching methods, assignments, and assessments to meet the diverse needs of your students. Ongoing data collection and analysis allow you to monitor student progress throughout the instructional period. Data can inform you about areas where students are struggling or excelling, and you can use this information to provide additional support and guidance for improvement.

Once you've implemented your practice, you'll be ready to write a reflection on the experience.
